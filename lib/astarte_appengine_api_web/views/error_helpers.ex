    # Because error messages were defined within Ecto, we must
    # call the Gettext module passing our Gettext backend. We

    # in the errors.po file.
    # Ecto will pass the :count keyword if the error message is
    # meant to be pluralized.
    # On your own code and templates, depending on whether you
    # need the message to be pluralized or not, this could be
    # written simply as:
    #
    #     dngettext "errors", "1 file", "%{count} files", count
    #     dgettext "errors", "is invalid"
